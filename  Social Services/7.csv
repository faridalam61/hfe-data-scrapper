Our goal at NTACE is to provide a continuum of care for individuals and their families.
The staff at North Texas Addiction Counseling and Education, Inc. is dedicated to ensuring that effective treatment, recovery, and prevention services are provided to meet the needs of individuals, both adults and adolescents, who suffer from drug and alcohol related problems. We assist those who live at or below the poverty level and are at the greatest risk of addiction-related disease and socio-economic dysfunction. We currently provide services to those who have medical insurance, all forms of Medicaid, those eligible for state funding and those who prefer to be on a self-pay basis.

NTACE prides itself on using evidence and research-based curriculums for the program services we provide. NTACE has two locations in Tarrant County, Arlington and Fort Worth. NTACE has determined that the two locations provide easy access via city and public transportation. The Fort Worth location is located just south of downtown and is located on the bus line with three stops within a one block radius. Arlington does not have a public transit system; however, the location is centrally located that is easily accessible in south Arlington off a major thoroughfare, in close proximity to the two major interstates.

NTACE provides literature, counseling materials/documents and counseling at both facilities in Spanish as well. Because of the ever growing and increased need, NTACE employs bilingual counselors specifically to address specific client’s needs and to eliminate a potential language barrier. Cognizant of the population and community NTACE has served for the past 15 years, NTACE endeavors to maintain a level of care that is diverse and culturally competent.

Both NTACE facilities are licensed by the Department of State and Health Services.",https://tarrant.tx.networkofcare.org/pr/services/agency.aspx?pid=NORTHTEXASADDICTIONCOUNSELINGANDEDUCATION_19_1208_0
